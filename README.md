# Power-Bi-Self-Exam-
An Insurance company wants to visualize the financial performance of 
claims made against the policies. The data given contains the information 
about claims processed in the month of January and February. The aim is to 
plot visualisations which will provide a quick overview of claims data to the 
leadership.

 Dataset Information: 
The data consists of 1000 individual claims. The most important variable of 
interest is fraud_reported. This variable is labelled 1 if a certain claim is 
reported to be fraudulent and 0 otherwise. Each claim in the data is described 
by 40 different attributes, which are represented as columns. We can divide 
the descriptive attributes into four main categories: the insured person, the 
policy of that person, description of the incident and characteristics of the car 
which is involved in the incident. 

## Perform the following tasks using PowerBI with the 
goal to visualise: 
Q1. Various factors like number of claims processed and the 
total amount approved across various states 
Q2. Count of incidents and impact of time, gender and vehicle 
age.
